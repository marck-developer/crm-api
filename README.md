# crm-api

This project is in response of the tech challenge proposed
by Code Sherpas. Is about creating a simple REST API that
can perform a CRUD. 

It simulates that there is a team creating 
an small on-line shop and some part of the team is doing the front end
and I'm responible for the API to manage the customers.

## Installation

first npm i to install all dependencies needed to run the project

then start the server typing in the terminal node customer-api.js

you can see results on localhost:300

with that is enough to verify for example with postman that all the endpoints 
are working and you can perform all the CRUD required

additonally i create some front-end just to be more visual,
i create a form just to perform create a new customer and another html
to read all customers
